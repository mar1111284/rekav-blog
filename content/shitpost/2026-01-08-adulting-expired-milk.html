  <h2 class="post-title">Adulting Level: Expired Milk</h2>
  <time class="post-date" datetime="2026-01-08">January 8, 2026</time>
  <p class="post-excerpt">Opened the fridge. Found milk that expired during the previous government. Still smelled better than my life decisions.</p>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Current achievements:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>knows where the good 24h convenience store is</li>
      <li>can survive 72 hours on instant noodles and existential dread</li>
      <li>owns 7 different kinds of hot sauce but no vegetables</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At this point I'm not sure if I'm living or just participating in an extremely long stress test.</p>

    <p>Send help. Or dumplings. Mostly dumplings.</p>
